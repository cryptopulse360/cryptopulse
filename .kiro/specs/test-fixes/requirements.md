# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CryptoPulse website has been successfully implemented but currently has multiple failing tests across different areas of the codebase. These test failures prevent reliable continuous integration and deployment, and indicate potential runtime issues that could affect user experience. This specification addresses the systematic fixing of all failing tests to ensure code quality, reliability, and maintainability of the CryptoPulse website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Import and Export Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all component imports and exports to work correctly so that tests can properly render components and verify functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running ErrorBoundary tests THEN the system SHALL properly import and render the ErrorBoundary component
2. WHEN running Header accessibility tests THEN the system SHALL properly import and render the Header component
3. WHEN running error integration tests THEN the system SHALL properly import all required components for nested error scenarios
4. WHEN running featured page tests THEN the system SHALL properly import the Breadcrumb component from the correct path
5. WHEN components are imported THEN the system SHALL ensure all exports match the expected interface

### Requirement 2: Search Modal Functionality Issues

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search modal to function correctly with proper focus management so that I can efficiently search for content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the search modal opens THEN the system SHALL properly set autoFocus on the search input
2. WHEN testing search modal accessibility THEN the system SHALL manage focus correctly for screen readers
3. WHEN the search input is rendered THEN the system SHALL have the autoFocus attribute present in the DOM
4. WHEN testing search functionality THEN the system SHALL handle keyboard navigation properly

### Requirement 3: Newsletter API Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the newsletter subscription to handle all scenarios correctly so that I can subscribe without encountering errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to subscribe with a duplicate email THEN the system SHALL return a 400 status code
2. WHEN a group ID is provided in subscription THEN the system SHALL include the group ID in the API response
3. WHEN an empty group ID is provided THEN the system SHALL return an empty array for groups
4. WHEN newsletter subscription is processed THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases properly

### Requirement 4: Tag Utilities Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want tag-based article filtering to work correctly so that I can find related content efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling getRelatedArticles THEN the system SHALL receive a proper array of articles that supports filter operations
2. WHEN filtering articles by tags THEN the system SHALL return related articles based on shared tags
3. WHEN limiting results THEN the system SHALL respect the maxResults parameter
4. WHEN no related articles exist THEN the system SHALL return an empty array
5. WHEN the current article is in results THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the returned results

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Boundaries

**User Story:** As a user, I want error boundaries to work correctly so that application errors are handled gracefully without breaking the entire interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components throw errors THEN the system SHALL render error boundaries properly
2. WHEN nested errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them with appropriate fallbacks
3. WHEN image loading fails THEN the system SHALL show proper fallback images
4. WHEN error recovery is attempted THEN the system SHALL allow users to retry failed operations
5. WHEN different error types occur THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately

### Requirement 6: Contact Page Content and Layout

**User Story:** As a user, I want the contact page to display information clearly so that I can find the appropriate contact method for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying contact information THEN the system SHALL ensure unique identification of similar content
2. WHEN showing social media links THEN the system SHALL provide proper accessible link elements
3. WHEN displaying response times THEN the system SHALL avoid duplicate text that confuses test selectors
4. WHEN providing technical support information THEN the system SHALL use clear, testable text content
5. WHEN laying out contact information THEN the system SHALL maintain proper grid structure

### Requirement 7: Performance Testing Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance tests to run correctly in the test environment so that I can verify performance optimizations work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing performance utilities THEN the system SHALL mock browser APIs that are not available in test environment
2. WHEN testing prefersReducedMotion THEN the system SHALL handle cases where matchMedia is not available
3. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallbacks for missing browser features
4. WHEN testing in Node.js environment THEN the system SHALL mock DOM APIs appropriately

### Requirement 8: Open Graph Image Integration

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want Open Graph image generation to work correctly so that articles display properly when shared on social media.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing OG image generation THEN the system SHALL properly match expected object structures
2. WHEN generating OG images THEN the system SHALL integrate correctly with SEO metadata
3. WHEN testing OG image workflow THEN the system SHALL handle the complete generation process
4. WHEN validating OG images THEN the system SHALL ensure proper metadata integration

### Requirement 9: API Error Logging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error logging to work correctly so that I can monitor and debug issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging client errors THEN the system SHALL properly sanitize malicious input
2. WHEN testing error logging THEN the system SHALL match expected log message formats
3. WHEN handling error data THEN the system SHALL process timestamps and user agents correctly
4. WHEN validating logged errors THEN the system SHALL ensure proper data structure

### Requirement 10: Test Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to run reliably in the CI/CD environment so that I can trust the test results for deployment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in CI THEN the system SHALL provide consistent results across different environments
2. WHEN mocking external dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure mocks match production behavior
3. WHEN testing components THEN the system SHALL properly configure the test environment for React components
4. WHEN running accessibility tests THEN the system SHALL have proper DOM testing utilities configured
5. WHEN validating test coverage THEN the system SHALL ensure all critical paths are tested
