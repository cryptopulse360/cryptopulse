# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create fast deployment workflow





  - Create new GitHub workflow file for streamlined deployment
  - Configure workflow to skip comprehensive tests and focus on build + deploy

  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Create quality assurance workflow





  - Move comprehensive tests to separate workflow file
  - Configure workflow to run on pull requests and manual triggers
  - Include all existing test suites, type checking, and quality checks
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Update Next.js configuration for deployment modes





  - Add environment-based build optimizations

  - Create clear error reporting with troubleshooting steps
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 7. Update existing deployment workflow





  - Rename current deploy.yml to quality-check.yml
  - Update triggers to run on PRs instead of main branch pushes
  - Ensure comprehensive testing remains available for development
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4_

- [ ]* 8. Add deployment monitoring and alerting
