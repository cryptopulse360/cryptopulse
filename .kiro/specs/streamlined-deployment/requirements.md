# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current GitHub Pages deployment process fails consistently due to extensive test suites (17,000+ lines) and strict type checking requirements. This feature will create a streamlined deployment workflow that prioritizes getting the website online while maintaining the option to run comprehensive tests separately. The goal is to have a reliable, fast deployment process that can be used for production while keeping development quality checks available as optional workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want my site to deploy to GitHub Pages successfully every time I push to main, so that my content is always available online without deployment failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the deployment workflow SHALL complete successfully within 10 minutes
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL skip comprehensive test suites by default
3. WHEN type checking fails THEN the deployment SHALL continue with warnings instead of failing
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the website SHALL be accessible at the GitHub Pages URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optionally run comprehensive tests and quality checks, so that I can maintain code quality without blocking deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to run full tests THEN I SHALL be able to trigger a separate quality check workflow manually
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN comprehensive tests SHALL run automatically for code review
3. WHEN the optional quality workflow runs THEN it SHALL include all existing tests, type checking, and linting
4. WHEN quality checks fail THEN they SHALL not prevent the main deployment from succeeding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website maintainer, I want deployment failures to be rare and easily debuggable, so that I can quickly resolve any issues that do occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment fails THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
2. WHEN build artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be verified before deployment
3. WHEN custom domains are configured THEN the deployment SHALL handle CNAME files correctly
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the workflow SHALL verify the site is accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want fast deployment cycles, so that I can publish content updates quickly without waiting for extensive test suites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is updated THEN the deployment SHALL complete in under 5 minutes for content-only changes
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL only include essential build steps for deployment
3. WHEN static assets are processed THEN the build SHALL optimize for deployment speed over comprehensive validation
4. WHEN the deployment workflow runs THEN it SHALL provide progress feedback and completion status
